# Holiday-Appetiser-App

In our team, we conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. We used agile development methodologies to help us work collaboratively. We implemented features and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests. We used GitHub Project to track the status of our project tasks which helped us to better understand the benefits of Kanban boards.We have used everything we’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that we’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.
