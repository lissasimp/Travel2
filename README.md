## Features
### This application has the following features:
- A user can generate information about a city by entering a city name in the search bar, clicking on Surprise Me or by selecting one of the previous searches.
- The application displays a 4 day weather forecast; some handy city facts including timezone; a carousel of images; a translation app and some interesting places to visit.
- A random city is generated from an array and page is dynamically updated.
- If a user enters incorrect information, a modal will appear to guide them.

## User Story
As a prospective traveler, I would like an application that allows me to search for key information about a city I wish to visit or to explore other cities I may wish to visit. When I am on the homepage, I am presented with key information for my chosen city in an easy to navigate and clearly presented format.  When looking for places of interest, I am provided with 6 options and additionally the opportunity to explore further on Wikipedia.
